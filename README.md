# BeachMap

A small GIS app for mapping Israel's beautiful beaches.

BeachMap has been built using the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) JS library and designed using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

Login functionality is using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

Created by Hila Tewel, Yuval Shor and Eliad Tzemach as a school project for our GIS Development Course at HIT.
